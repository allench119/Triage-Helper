# Triage-Helper

***This repo is migrated from another github account that i own(from https://github.com/allleeennn/Aloha). I've stopped using the old account and the triage repo on the old account is out-dated as well.***

This app is built by me(allench119), Jacky Shum(jackys-95), Zoe Wang(Zooeee) and Alex Tse(chuunilover) in 2014.

It is a hospital medical triage helper application which was built on Andrioid SDK, Java and SQLite.
It provides detailed medical divisions and multiple health indices, also supports account operations and different features for doctors and nurses.
