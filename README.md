# Triage-Helper

* This repo is migrated from another github account that i own(from https://github.com/allleeennn/Aloha). I've stopped using the old account. *

* The repo on the old account is out-dated because we used Github for version control only due to an accidental SVN server down. *

* This app contains the final version of this app. *
This app is built by me(allench119), Jacky Shum(jackys-95), Zoe Wang(Zooeee) and Alex Tse(chuunilover) in 2014.

It is a hospital medical triage helper application which was built on Andrioid SDK, Java and SQLite.
It provides detailed medical divisions and multiple health indices, also supports account operations and different features for doctors and nurses.
